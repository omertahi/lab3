# STAT 450 Lab 3

The plot shown in the lab2.R file represents the relationship between Bill depth and Bill length for each of the 3 penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo.
We can see that Adelie has the shortest Bill length on average along with a realtively large Bill depth. 
Chinstrap has a similar Bill depth however it has a larger Bill length on average.
Lastly, the Gentoo species has a Bill length similar to that of Chinstrap but the Bill depth is the smallest (on average) of the other 2 species.
